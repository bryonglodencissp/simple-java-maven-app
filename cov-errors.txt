  Checker: BAD_CHECK_OF_WAIT_COND
  Triage unavailable.
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:137:
  lock_acquire: Acquiring lock "BCWCExamples.lock".
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:141:
  if_insufficient: This if cannot adequately check the wait condition, as it does not cause the thread to wait again if the wait ends due to a spurious wakeup.
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:142:
  wait_cond_improperly_checked: The wait condition prompting the wait upon "BCWCExamples.lock" is not checked correctly. If a spurious wakeup occurs, the thread could continue its task before the wait condition is satisfied.
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:142:
  add_loop_check_inside_lock: Refactor the code to protect the call to wait with a loop that rechecks the wait condition inside the locked region.

  lock_acquire: Acquiring lock "BCWCExamples.lock".
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:151:
  loop_outside_lock_insufficient: Because this loop occurs outside the locked region, it cannot be a sufficient check of the wait condition. The value of the wait condition may change between the check of the loop condition and the call to wait.
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:153:
  wait_cond_improperly_checked: The wait condition prompting the wait upon "BCWCExamples.lock" is not checked correctly. This code can wait for a condition that has already been satisfied, which can cause a never-ending wait.
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:153:
  add_loop_check_inside_lock: Refactor the code to protect the call to wait with a loop that rechecks the wait condition inside the locked region.

  lock_acquire: Acquiring lock "BCWCExamples.lock".
src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java:132:
  wait_cond_improperly_checked: The wait performed by "lock.wait()" is not contained in a loop and is not guarded by the check of a wait condition. Thus, it is possible to wait after the condition has already been satisfied, which may result in a never-ending wait.
